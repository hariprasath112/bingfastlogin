## FAQ

#### 1. Do I need to provide my login credentials?

No, You save your password in Chrome. Extension doesn't work if username+password is not saved.

#### 2. How can I add my TOTP?

If you don't know your secret, go to the 2FA set up page to get your QR.
Or, if you use the Autheticator chrome extension already. Take a screenshot of the QR for your 2FA, open the screenshot image in new tab and hit "Scan QR" in BingFastLogin.
